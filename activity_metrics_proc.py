Activity Metrics Processing File
--------------------------------
'Activity Metrics' are metrics related to the amount of interactions a user
has with a social network platform, and also the characteristics of those
interactions (frequency, long-form, seasonal, recreation-vs-professional etc..)

Some of these metrics are unrelated to the focus of this project, which is to
understand the personality, goals, and beliefs of a user. Some of these metrics
are vaguely related.

They are kept separately from the 'core' of the project here in this file.
