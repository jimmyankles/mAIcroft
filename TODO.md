# mAIcroft **TODOs**

##### Remove 'Processing' code from RedditUser class in [reddit_user.py](/reddit_user.py), and try and generalise it to work with other social media content.

##### Implement better Named Entity Recognition (NER)

##### Extract out the 'reddit metrics' code, as that isn't really the focus of the project.
 We are only interested in the frequency of submission, and the 'best' submissions insofar as they contribute to and understanding of their personality, beliefs, goals  

###### Remove Faulty Male/Female logic in derive_attributes()
Just because someone has a husband, that does not mean that they are necessarily a woman, and vice versa. This logic will be accurate most of the time, but it is not really intelligent.
